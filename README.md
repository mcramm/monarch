# Monarch

A Leiningen plugin to handle rails-style migrations.

## Usage

Use this for user-level plugins:

Put `[monarch "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile, or if you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install
monarch 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[monarch "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

The default config will look for migration files in `data/migrations`, and will
track which versions have been applied in the `schema_versions` table. You can
override these defaults by adding a `:migrations` key pointing at a map in your
project.clj like this:

`
:migrations {:table     "schema_versions"
             :location  "data/migrations"}
`

* `:location` identifies where to look for migrations.
* `:table` is the name of the table that tracks which migrations have been
applied.

## Caveats

This library has only been tested on Unix with Postgres. If you encounter any
issues with your platform/database, please open an issue.

## Setup

You will need to have set an environment variable, `DATABASE_URL`, that contains
the connection information to your database.

Example (Unix):

`export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/helloworld"`


Once you've done that, run `lein monarch :setup` to create the table that tracks
the applied migrations. By default this is `schema_versions`, but can be
overridden as mentioned above.

## Migrations

Migrations are currently E.D.N. data, and take the form of a map with an `:up`
and `:down` keys:

`{:up [] :down []}`

You can place an arbitrary sequence of statements in the supplied vector, and they
will be executed in the order defined. All statements are applied in a
transaction.

Example:
`
{:up ["CREATE TABLE users (
          id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
          email TEXT,
          password TEXT
       )"
      "CREATE TABLE posts (
          id SERIAL,
          user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
          title TEXT,
          body TEXT
      )"]
 :down ["DROP TABLE posts"
        "DROP TABLE users"]}
`

## Available Commands

Examples
    $ lein monarch :setup           # Run necessary setup.
    $ lein monarch :generate <name> # generate a new migration file

    $ lein monarch
    $ lein monarch :up              # apply all outstanding migrations

    $ lein monarch :rollback        # roll the database back one version
